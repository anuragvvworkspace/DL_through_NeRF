NeRF is a generative model of sorts.

What is a generative model?

Read wiki generative model: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model

In statistical classification, two main approaches are called the generative approach and the discriminative approach.

A generative model is a statistical model of the joint probability distribution P(X,Y) on given observable variable X and target variable Y

A discriminative model is a model of the conditional probability P(Y|X = x) of the target Y, given an observation x;

Standard examples of each, all of which are linear classifiers, are.

1. generative classifiers
  2. naive Bayes classifier and
  . linear discriminant analysis
. discriminative model:
. logistic regression
